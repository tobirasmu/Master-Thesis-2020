\section{Introduction}

Machine Learning (ML) has been a very useful tool in many areas for a long time. One of the biggest leaps in the discovery of the computer was Alan Turing's learning machine that was used to decrypt the German cipher during World War II \cite{Turing}. Alan Turing was widely considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence\cite{Beavers2013}. Ever since his work and with computers becoming better and more accessible, people have studied different ways of making machines learn different tasks. Today ML is used for everything from recignising handwriting to diagnosing breast cancer\cite{Khuriwal2018}. 

A big area in ML research is image classification and detection, which is respectively to classify an image into a set of predetermined classes or detect a given object in an image. By far the major method in learning images is the neural network (NN), which builds upon the idea of the brain with neurons firing up and sending information to each other through a network. Stacking multiple layers of neurons makes the machine able to extract higher level features, hence many layers (deep learning) are often preferred for complex problems.
