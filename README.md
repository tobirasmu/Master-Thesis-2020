# Master Thesis 2020
The master thesis of Tobias Engelhardt Rasmussen, to be performed in the fall of 2020.

This master thesis examines the potential synergy that appears when tensor decomposition is used as part of a convolutional neural network. It is believed that adding tensor decomposition will decrease the number of layers needed in the neural network, hence increase the efficiency.
